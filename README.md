# Blockchain Voting App

A decentralized voting platform built on blockchain technology using Solidity. The app aims to replace traditional political elections by providing a transparent, secure, and tamper-proof voting system. Using smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain, the app ensures that votes are anonymous, verifiable, and immutable.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting**: No central authority controls the voting process, ensuring fairness and transparency.
- **Smart Contract-based**: Voting logic is embedded into smart contracts, providing an automated and trustless system.
- **Transparency**: All votes are recorded on the blockchain, allowing anyone to verify the results without compromising voter anonymity.
- **Security**: Blockchain technology ensures that votes cannot be altered, preventing fraud and manipulation.
- **Anonymous Voting**: Voters can cast their ballots privately, and no personal information is stored on the blockchain.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development for Ethereum blockchain.
- **Ethereum**: Public blockchain for deploying and interacting with the voting contract.
- **Foundry**: Development framework for testing and deploying smart contracts.
- **Forge**: Tool for smart contract compilation, deployment, and testing in Foundry.
- **Ethers.js**: JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum blockchain from the front end.
- **Metamask**: Browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
